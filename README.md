We believe that working with data, specifically the exploration and integration part, should be fun! Therefore, our API and Python package is designed to seamlessly support a data scientist's and engineer's daily work.

If you have questions, feel free to reach out! 

The [Fusionbase](https://fusionbase.com/) python package is open source software released by Fusionbase's Engineering Team. It is available for download on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fusionbase/).

## Installation in Python - PyPI release

Fusionbase is on PyPI, so you can use `pip` to install it.

```bash
pip install fusionbase
```

If you want to use all features and be able to retrieve the data directly as pandas dataframes, you must make sure that pandas and numpy are installed.

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
```

Fusionbase by default uses the standard JSON library of Python to serialize and locally store data. However, you can use the faster `orjson` library as a drop-in replacement.&#x20;

Therefore, just install `orjson` and Fusionbase will automatically detect and use it.

```bash
pip install orjson
```

### Getting Started

Got to [examples](https://github.com/FusionbaseHQ/fusionbase-python/tree/main/examples) to deep dive into Fusionbase and see various examples on how to use the package.

Here are some Examples for a quick start:

#### Data Streams

The Data Stream module lets you conveniently access data and metadata of all Data Streams. Each stream can be accessed via its unique stream id or label.



**Setup**

```python
# Import Fusionbase
from fusionbase import Fusionbase

# Create a new datastream
# Provide your API Key
fusionbase = Fusionbase(auth={"api_key": "*** SECRET CREDENTIALS ***"})

# If you prefer to have extended logging output and information 
# Like a progress bar for downloading datastreams etc.
# Turn on the log 
fusionbase = Fusionbase(auth={"api_key": "*** SECRET CREDENTIALS ***"}, log=True)

# Get the datastream with the key "28654971"
data_stream_key = "28654971"
data_stream = fusionbase.get_datastream(data_stream_key)
```

****

**Human readable datastream information**

```python
# Print a nice table containing the meta data of the stream
data_stream.pretty_meta_data()
```

****

**Getting the data**

The samples below show how to retrieve the data of a datastream as a list of dictionaries. Each element in the list represents one row within the dataset.&#x20;

Note that the data can by hierarchical.

```python
# The following returns the full datastream as a list of dictionaries
# It uses a local cache if available
data = data_stream.get_data()
print(data)

# Get always the latest data from Fusionbase
data = data_stream.get_data(live=True)
print(data)

# If you only need a subset of the columns
# You'll gain much performance by only selecting those columns
data = data_stream.get_data(fields=["NAME_OF_COLUMN_1", "NAME_OF_COLUMN_N"])
print(data)

# If you need only an excerpt of the data you can use skip and limit
# The sample below gets the 10 first rows
data = data_stream.get_data(skip=0, limit=10)
print(data)

```

****

**Get Data as a** [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) **DataFrame**

If you are working with pandas, it is probably the most convenient way to load to data directly as a pandas DataFrame.

```python
# Load the data from Fusionbase, cache it and put it in a pandas DataFrame
df = data_stream.as_dataframe()
print(df)

# Force ignoring the cache and make sure to get the latest data
df = data_stream.as_dataframe(live=True)
print(df)
```



**Storing the data**

Large datasets potentially do not fit into the memory. Therefore, it is possible to get the data of a stream directly as partitioned files.&#x20;

The folder structure is automatically created and always like `./{ID-OF-THE-STREAM}/data/*`

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Store as JSON files
data_stream.as_json_files(storage_path=Path("./data/"))

# Store as CSV files
data_stream.as_csv_files(storage_path=Path("./data/"))

# Store as Pickle files
data_stream.as_pickle_files(storage_path=Path("./data/"))
```

####

#### Data Services

A data service can be seen as an API that returns a certain output for a specific input. For example, our address [normalization service](https://app.fusionbase.com/share/25127186) parses an address and returns the structured and normalized parts of it.

**Setup**

```python
# Import Fusionbase
from fusionbase.Fusionbase import Fusionbase

# Create a new dataservice
# Provide your API Key and the Fusionbase API URI (usually: https://api.fusionbase.com/api/v1)
fusionbase = Fusionbase(auth={"api_key": "*** SECRET CREDENTIALS ***"})

data_service_key = "23622632"
data_service = fusionbase.get_dataservice(data_service_key)
```

**Human readable dataservice information:**

```python
# Retrieves the metadata from a Service by giving a Service specific key and prints it nicely to console
data_service.pretty_meta_data()
```

**Human readable dataservice definition:**

```python
# Retrieve the request definition (such as required parameters) from a Service by giving a Service specific key and print it to console.
data_service.pretty_request_definition()
```

**Invoke a dataservice:**

```python
# Invoke a service by providing input data

# The following lines of code are equivalent
# Services can be invoked directly by their parameter names
result = data_service.invoke(address_string="Agnes-Pockels-Bogen 1, 80992 MÃ¼nchen")


# Or using a list of parameter key and value pairs
payload = [
    {
        "name": "address_string",  # THIS IS THE NAME OF THE INPUT VALUE
        "value": "Agnes-Pockels-Bogen 1, 80992 MÃ¼nchen"  # THE VALUE FOR THE INPUT
    }
]
result = data_service.invoke(parameters=payload)

print(result)
```
